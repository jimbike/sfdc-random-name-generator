# Salesforce Accounts with Contacts Generator
Creates a specified number of Accounts choosing randomly from a list of 400 company names and creates a random number of contacts associated with that account.  Each contact is given a name generated based on the top 100 last names, top 100 female first names, top 100 male first. Assists with user acceptance testing when needing large volumes of data in sandboxes, or for demo purposes.

I have found that it is very easy to create tons of fake data for testing configuration or code within sandboxes, or demoing proofs of concepts in production; however, it's trick to create a lot of fake data that actually has meaningful names. I'd prefer to use random data to a spreadsheet with the same names (e.g. presidents, famous people).

Here's the premise of how the **RandomNameGenerator.cls** works:

* Use the list of first names and last names as a starting point
* Multiply the result of Math.random() and the size of the names list, and typecast this as an integer
* Retrieve the first name / last name from the list based on this random integer
